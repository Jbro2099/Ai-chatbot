Rule-Based Chatbot with Python and NLTK
Overview

This project is a rule-based conversational chatbot built in Python using the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK). The chatbot interacts with users in English by responding to user inputs based on predefined patterns and reflections.

This demonstrates the fundamentals of Natural Language Processing (NLP), including pattern matching, token recognition, and conversational flow handling.


Features
-Handles greetings, questions, and common user statements.
-Processes user input using regular expressions and reflections.
-Provides context-aware responses based on user queries.
-Supports multiple response variations for more natural conversation.
-Easy to extend with additional patterns and responses.
